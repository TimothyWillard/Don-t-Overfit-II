>BinaryGibbsMetropolis: [xi]
>NUTS: [beta, coeff_shape, alpha]
The acceptance probability does not match the target. It is 0.999212516232218, but should be close to 0.8. Try to increase the number of tuning steps.
The chain reached the maximum tree depth. Increase max_treedepth, increase target_accept or reparameterize.
Only one chain was sampled, this makes it impossible to run some convergence checks
